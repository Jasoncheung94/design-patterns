## Bridge

The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently", introduced by the Gang of Four. The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.

Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or large class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.
