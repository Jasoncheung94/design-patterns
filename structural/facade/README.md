## Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

The facade pattern (also spelled façade) is a software-design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming. Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code. A facade can:

improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single (and often simplified) API
provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality (complete with context-specific input validation)
serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code.
