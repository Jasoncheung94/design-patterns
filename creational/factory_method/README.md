## Factory Pattern

Factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

Note: Go isn't an Object Oriented Programming language. Due to it's lack of features such as classes, inheritance a Simple Factory pattern will be added. This is a basic version of the pattern. When other languages are added I'll update this doc and add proper examples to give the overall idea.
