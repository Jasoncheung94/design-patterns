## Strategy

Strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

Short: lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
